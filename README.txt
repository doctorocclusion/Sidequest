sq2 Base Code

    This program is the base code for the third side quest assignment,
    SQ2 - Raytracer. Please refer to the project handout for more information.
    

Usage: 
    The user can click with the left mouse button and drag to affect the
    current angular direction of the camera; left <--> right affects the
    camera's theta value ("horizontal" angle), and up <--> down affects
    the camera's phi value ("vertical" angle). 
    
    Pressing the 'w' and 's' keys on the keyboard causes the camera 
    to move forward or backward, respectively. The keys can be held down
    to move constantly, and mouse motion can be used at the same time
    for a smoother flying experience.

    The user can also press the 'q' key to quit the program.

    Pressing 'r' invokes the raytracing callback and renders the scene
    in raytrace mode.

    Once raytracing is complete, pressing 't' toggles between preview
    mode and the final raytraced scene.

Notes:
    None.
