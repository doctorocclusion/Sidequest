# SQ-Tracer
This is a path-tracer I wrote and the tricked-out for CSCI441. It has many nice features including energy-conservation, totaly fudged BRDFs, and really long render times.

It still isn't practical, but I think you will agree it looks nice!

### Building
Theoreticaly you just need to install OpenGL, GLU, and FreeGLUT then run the Makefile. How does that work in practice? Not sure. Good luck I guess.
